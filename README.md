# Utilities for Web Infrastructure Ops

This repository has a few scripts that I use for the Uxtely
infrastructure, but you can adapt them to your needs. Some
of them have companion [blog posts](https://blog.uxtely.com)
&mdash; look for them in the initial comments of each script.


## Placeholders
These scripts use `example.com` domain names
and `192.0.2/24` IP addresses as placeholders.


## License
All the scripts are [ISC licensed](./LICENSE).
